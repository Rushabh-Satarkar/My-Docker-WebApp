# My-Docker-WebApp
A Docker project that demonstrates how to create and deploy a custom Nginx web server image. The project utilizes Docker Desktop for image creation and management, and then deploys the custom image to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It includes a custom   index.html file that replaces the default Nginx welcome page.
